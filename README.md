# Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets using machine learning. It allows users to either input custom text or fetch recent tweets from a Twitter user, then classifies each as Positive or Negative. The app uses a trained model with TF-IDF vectorization and displays results with a visually appealing interface built in Streamlit.
